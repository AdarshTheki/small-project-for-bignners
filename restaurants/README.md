## Create React App with Restaurant Project

1. This is a JavaScript file that defines a React component called `Restaurant`. 
2. It imports the `useState` hook and three other components (`Navbar`, `MenuCard`, and `myAPI`) from other files. 
3. It also creates a unique list of categories from the `myAPI` data using the `Set` object and the `map`
method.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
