## Create Forms in React App with Firebase : 

1. This is a React component that allows users to `sign up`, `log in`, and `log in with Google` using `Firebase` authentication.
2. It imports necessary functions from the Firebase auth library and initializes the Firebase app with the provided configuration.
3. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage form data and updates the state when the user types in the input fields. The component also includes functions to `handle form` submissions for sign up, log in, and Google log in.
4. The component renders two forms for sign up and log in, respectively, and a `button` for Google log in. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
